This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to classify network traffic as either normal or anomalous using the KDD99 dataset. The dataset contains 41 features representing various attributes of network connections. Initially, the data was loaded and inspected for any missing values and duplicates. Data preprocessing included label encoding for categorical features and dropping the 'num_outbound_cmds' column due to its redundancy. Feature selection was performed using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest Classifier, identifying ten significant features.
The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, and features were standardized using a StandardScaler. Logistic Regression was implemented as a baseline model, achieving a training accuracy of 93.5% and a testing accuracy of 93.2%. To optimize hyperparameters, Optuna was employed, demonstrating its effectiveness by tuning a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, which yielded an accuracy of 98.27% on the testing set with the best configuration.
